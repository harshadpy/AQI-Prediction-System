# üìä AQI Prediction with Ensemble Learning

> A machine learning project to predict Air Quality Index (AQI) using various ensemble techniques.

-----

## üöÄ Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate machine learning models for **Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction**. It utilizes a synthetic dataset, simulates real-world air pollutant measurements, and employs several ensemble learning methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, Bagging, AdaBoost, and a Voting Classifier) to achieve robust predictions. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive evaluation with visualizations.

-----

## ‚ú® Features

  * **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creates a realistic-looking dataset of air pollutant measurements and calculated AQI levels.
  * **Data Preprocessing**: Handles feature scaling and target encoding for model readiness.
  * **Ensemble Learning**: Implements and compares:
      * **Random Forest Classifier**
      * **XGBoost Classifier**
      * **Bagging Classifier**
      * **AdaBoost Classifier**
      * **Voting Classifier** (combining the best performing models)
  * **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses `GridSearchCV` to optimize the performance of individual models.
  * **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Provides metrics and visualizations, including:
      * Accuracy Score
      * ROC AUC Score
      * Confusion Matrix
      * ROC Curves (One-vs-Rest)
      * Feature Importance Plots
      * Distribution analysis of CO levels and other features.

## üíª How to Run

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-directory>
```

*(Replace `<your-repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository and `<your-project-directory>` with your desired project folder name.)*

-----

### 2\. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn
```

-----

### 3\. Execute the Script

Run the main Python script from your terminal:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

*(Replace `your_script_name.py` with the actual name of your Python file, e.g., `aqi_predictor.py`)*

This will:

1.  Generate a synthetic dataset named `synthetic_aqi_data.csv`.
2.  Train and evaluate the machine learning models.
3.  Display various plots and print evaluation metrics in your console.

-----

## üìä Results and Visualizations

The script will output accuracy scores and generate several plots to help you understand the model's performance and data characteristics:

  * **Model Accuracy Comparison**: Bar chart comparing the accuracies of Random Forest and XGBoost.
  * **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes the performance of the ensemble model by showing correct vs. incorrect predictions for each AQI category.
  * **ROC Curve (One-vs-Rest)**: Illustrates the diagnostic ability of the binary classifiers as their discrimination threshold is varied.
  * **Feature Importance**: Identifies the most influential features in predicting AQI, derived from the best Random Forest model.
  * **CO Quality Distribution**: Shows the distribution of predicted Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels and their corresponding quality categories.
  * **Concentrations of all features in Test Set**: Histograms for each scaled feature in the test set, showing their distributions.
